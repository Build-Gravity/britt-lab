            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Find a psychology study that interests you and document a plan to adapt it into a web experiment.</p>

            <h3>üéØ Goal: Find Research That Interests You</h3>
            <p>Before coding anything, you need to find research that interests you and understand what makes experiments effective. Look for studies that seem particularly clever or insightful.</p>
            <p><strong>By the end of this step:</strong> You'll have found an interesting study to be transformed into a digital psych experiment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step-section">
            <h3>‚≠ê Our Example: A Rock-Paper-Scissors Study</h3>
            <p>To demonstrate the process, we chose the following study as our inspiration. Throughout this tutorial, we will build a web-based version of this experiment, and you will adapt each step to build your own.</p>
            <div class="reference-box">
                <p><strong>Study Reference:</strong><br>
                Mohammadi Sepahvand, N., St√∂ttinger, E., Danckert, J., & Anderson, B. (2014). Sequential decisions: A computational comparison of observational and reinforcement accounts. <em>PLoS ONE, 9</em>(4), e94308.</p>
                <p><strong>Research Question:</strong><br>
                How do humans build and update mental models to make sequential decisions under uncertainty? Specifically, when playing against an opponent whose strategy changes over time, do people use statistical learning (trying to predict what the opponent will do next) or reinforcement learning (learning which actions tend to lead to wins)? The study tested this by having participants play Rock-Paper-Scissors against a computer that shifted from random play to increasingly biased strategies, then used computational modeling to determine which learning approach best explained human behavior.</p>
                <p><strong>Our Adaptation:</strong><br>
                Build a web-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where participants play 30-50 rounds against multiple AI opponents with different learning strategies. We implement the original study's biased algorithms (random play, lightly biased toward rock at 50%, heavily biased toward paper at 80%) plus additional research-validated AI algorithms including RELPH (reinforcement learning) and ELPH (statistical learning) from the original paper. We track participant choices, reaction times, win rates, learning curves, and strategy adaptation patterns. The experiment measures whether participants detect different AI strategy types and adapt their play accordingly, while collecting rich behavioral data including choice entropy, pattern recognition, and individual differences in learning rates suitable for computational modeling and statistical analysis.</p>

            <h3>üìö Phase 1: Find Your Study to Replicate</h3>
            <p>The goal is simple: <strong>find an article about a psychology experiment that interests you and that you want to recreate</strong>. Here are some approaches to help you get there:</p>
            
            <div class="step-box">
                <h4>üìñ Literature Search</h4>
                <p>Browse psychology research directly:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> Search for "psychology experiment" + your interests (memory, attention, decision-making)</li>

                <p>Find classic studies to replicate or extend:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Many Labs projects:</strong> Large-scale replication efforts often highlight important studies</li>
                    <li><strong>Textbook experiments:</strong> Classic findings that could benefit from modern web-based testing</li>

                <h4>üìù Document Your Chosen Study</h4>
                <p>Once you've selected a study, create a markdown file in your repository with the study's key details. This should include the abstract, main findings, methodology, and your notes about why it interests you.

            <div class="step-box">
                <h4>üîç What to Look For</h4>
                <p>As you review potential studies, ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What interests me about this experiment or result?</strong> - Look for findings that surprise you, challenge assumptions, or reveal something counterintuitive about how the mind works. The best experiments often show that our everyday intuitions about cognition are wrong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Could I realistically build this?</strong> - Digital experiments work best with simple interactions: clicking, typing, choosing between options, or timing responses. Avoid studies requiring specialized equipment, complex stimuli, or face-to-face interaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Is the method clear enough to adapt?</strong> - You should understand what participants actually do step-by-step. If the procedure seems vague or overly complex, it may be difficult to implement faithfully.</li>
                    <li><strong>Would this generate meaningful data quickly?</strong> - Online participants have limited attention spans. Look for experiments that can reveal interesting patterns within 5-10 minutes of testing.</li>
                    <li><strong>How could I improve or extend this study?</strong> - Consider optional modifications: Could you add new measures? Test different populations? Vary the conditions? Think about what the original authors might have done differently or what questions they left unanswered.</li>
