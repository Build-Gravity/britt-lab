        <h1>Understanding AI Algorithms in Rock-Paper-Scissors</h1>
        
        <p>This page explains the five AI algorithms used in our experiment. Understanding these helps us think about how artificial intelligence makes decisions and learns from data.</p>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>1. Random AI - The Baseline</h2>
            <p>The simplest AI just picks randomly every time. This gives us a <span class="highlight">baseline</span> to compare other algorithms against.</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>makeMove() {
    const choices = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors'];
    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    return choices[randomIndex];
}</code>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Why it's useful:</strong> Random play is unpredictable. No strategy can consistently beat it - you'll win about 33% of the time, lose 33%, and tie 33%.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>2. Counter AI - Simple Memory</h2>
            <p>This AI remembers your last move and plays the move that would beat it. It assumes you'll repeat your previous choice.</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>makeMove() {
    // If no previous moves, play randomly
    if (this.playerHistory.length === 0) {
        return this.playRandom();
    }

    // Get the player's last move
    const lastPlayerMove = this.playerHistory[this.playerHistory.length - 1];
    
    // Play the move that beats their last move
    if (lastPlayerMove === 'Rock') return 'Paper';
    if (lastPlayerMove === 'Paper') return 'Scissors';
    if (lastPlayerMove === 'Scissors') return 'Rock';
}</code>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy insight:</strong> This works well against players who repeat moves or get stuck in patterns. However, once you realize what it's doing, you can easily beat it by avoiding repetition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>3. Frequency Counter AI - Statistical Analysis</h2>
            <p>This AI tracks which move you use most often and always plays the counter to that favorite move.</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>makeMove() {
    // Track frequencies: { Rock: 5, Paper: 3, Scissors: 2 }
    let mostFrequent = 'Rock';
    let maxCount = this.playerFrequency.Rock;
    
    if (this.playerFrequency.Paper > maxCount) {
        mostFrequent = 'Paper';
        maxCount = this.playerFrequency.Paper;
    }
    if (this.playerFrequency.Scissors > maxCount) {
        mostFrequent = 'Scissors';
    }

    // Play the move that beats their most frequent choice
    if (mostFrequent === 'Rock') return 'Paper';
    if (mostFrequent === 'Paper') return 'Scissors';
    if (mostFrequent === 'Scissors') return 'Rock';
}</code>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Strategy insight:</strong> Most people have unconscious biases toward certain moves. This AI exploits your overall tendencies rather than short-term patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>4. Biased Random AI - Research Replication</h2>
            <p>This AI replicates the exact strategy from the Mohammadi Sepahvand et al. (2014) research study. It has three phases with increasing bias toward certain moves.</p>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>makeMove() {
    const random = Math.random();
    
    if (this.moveCount <= 200) {
        // Phase 1: Random (33% each)
        return choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];
    } else if (this.moveCount <= 400) {
        // Phase 2: Light bias (50% Rock, 25% Paper, 25% Scissors)
        if (random < 0.5) return 'Rock';
        if (random < 0.75) return 'Paper';
        return 'Scissors';
    } else {
        // Phase 3: Heavy bias (10% Rock, 80% Paper, 10% Scissors)
        if (random < 0.1) return 'Rock';
        if (random < 0.9) return 'Paper';
        return 'Scissors';
    }
}</code>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Research purpose:</strong> This AI was used in the original study to test how humans adapt to changing opponent strategies. The gradual bias increase tests human pattern detection abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>5. ELPH AI - Advanced Pattern Recognition</h2>
            <p>The most sophisticated AI, implementing the ELPH (Entropy Learned Pruned Hypothesis space) algorithm from academic research. It uses advanced mathematics to detect and exploit patterns.</p>
            
            <h3>How ELPH works:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Short Term Memory (STM):</strong> Remembers your last few moves (configurable 1-8 moves)</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothesis Generation:</strong> Creates all possible pattern predictions from STM</li>
                <li><strong>Entropy Calculation:</strong> Measures how "random" each pattern is using H = -Σ p_i * log₂(p_i)</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothesis Pruning:</strong> Removes unreliable patterns with high entropy</li>
                <li><strong>Soft-max Selection:</strong> Probabilistically chooses the most reliable pattern</li>
                <li><strong>Prediction & Counter:</strong> Predicts your next move and plays the counter</li>
            </ol>
            
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>// Example: Your last 3 moves were Rock-Paper-Scissors
// ELPH generates hypotheses:
// "Rock" → ? (from all games starting with Rock)
// "Paper" → ? (from all games where Paper was played)
// "Rock-Paper" → ? (from all Rock-Paper sequences)
// "Paper-Scissors" → ? (from all Paper-Scissors sequences)
// "Rock-Paper-Scissors" → ? (from all Rock-Paper-Scissors sequences)

// It calculates entropy for each pattern:
// "Rock-Paper" has low entropy (you always play Scissors after this)
// "Paper" has high entropy (you play randomly after Paper)

// It selects the most reliable pattern and counters your predicted move</code>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Why it's challenging:</strong> ELPH combines the best of all strategies - it finds your patterns like Pattern AI, but uses rigorous mathematics to avoid false patterns. It's designed to be as close to optimal play as possible.</p>
            
            <h3>ELPH Parameters:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>STM Length:</strong> How many recent moves to analyze (1-8)</li>
                <li><strong>Entropy Threshold:</strong> Maximum randomness allowed in trusted patterns (0.5-2.0)</li>
                <li><strong>Min Observations:</strong> How much evidence needed before trusting a pattern (2-10)</li>
                <li><strong>Hypothesis Pruning:</strong> Whether to remove unreliable patterns (On/Off)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>Key AI Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3>Learning vs. Strategy Comparison</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Random AI:</strong> No learning, no strategy - pure baseline</li>
                <li><strong>Counter AI:</strong> No learning, simple reactive strategy</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Counter AI:</strong> Simple learning, statistical strategy</li>
                <li><strong>Biased Random AI:</strong> No learning, evolving strategy over time</li>
                <li><strong>ELPH AI:</strong> Advanced learning, adaptive mathematical strategy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Prediction and Confidence</h3>
            <p>The advanced AIs use different confidence measures:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>// Frequency Counter: Only predict if enough data
if (totalMoves >= 5) {
    return mostFrequentMove;
}

// ELPH: Only predict if entropy is low enough
if (patternEntropy <= entropyThreshold && observations >= minObservations) {
    return reliablePattern;
}</code>
            </div>
            <p>This prevents the AIs from making overconfident predictions based on limited or unreliable data.</p>
            
            <h3>Fallback Strategies</h3>
            <p>Good AI systems have fallbacks when their primary strategy fails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Counter AI:</strong> Falls back to random for first move</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency Counter AI:</strong> Falls back to random when no clear favorite</li>
                <li><strong>ELPH AI:</strong> Falls back to frequency analysis when no reliable patterns</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="algorithm-section">
            <h2>Testing AI Intelligence</h2>
            
            <p>As you play against these AIs, ask yourself:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you detect which AI you're playing against based on their behavior?</li>
                <li>How does your strategy change once you know the AI's approach?</li>
                <li>Which AI feels most "human-like" to play against?</li>
                <li>How long does it take the ELPH AI to "figure you out"?</li>
                <li>Can you exploit the Biased Random AI's phase transitions?</li>
                <li>Does the Counter AI become predictable after a few rounds?</li>
                <li>How does the Frequency Counter AI adapt when you change your favorite move?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Experimental Questions</h3>
            <p>These AIs enable interesting research questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Detection Time:</strong> How quickly can humans identify different AI strategies?</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> Do people change their play style against different AIs?</li>
                <li><strong>Learning Curves:</strong> Which AIs do humans learn to beat fastest?</li>
                <li><strong>Phase Sensitivity:</strong> Do humans notice when the Biased Random AI changes phases?</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Breaking:</strong> Can humans successfully stay random against ELPH?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Research note:</strong> These questions mirror real research in AI detection, human-computer interaction, and game theory. Understanding how people interact with different AI systems is crucial for designing better technology.</p>
