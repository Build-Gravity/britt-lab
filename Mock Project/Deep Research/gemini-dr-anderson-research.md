# **An Analytical Profile of Dr. Britt Anderson for Experimental Design**

## **Section I: Executive Profile of Dr. Britt Anderson: The Neurologist-Theorist**

### **1.1 Academic and Professional Identity**

Dr. Britt Anderson, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Waterloo, occupies a distinctive position in cognitive neuroscience. His intellectual identity is fundamentally shaped by a non-traditional academic trajectory that combines extensive clinical experience with deep theoretical and computational inquiry. Dr. Anderson earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of Arizona in 1980, followed by a medical degree (MD) from the University of Southern California in 1984\.1 He subsequently trained in neurology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and worked in the field of Behavioural Neurology.3 This foundation in clinical practice, which involves direct engagement with the complexities of brain injury and its cognitive sequelae, provides an empirical grounding that informs his entire research program.

Decades after his medical training, Dr. Anderson pursued and completed a PhD in Brain Science at Brown University in 2006, where he was a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow from 2000 to 2006\.1 Since 2007, he has been a faculty member at the University of Waterloo, where he is appointed to Psychology in Cognitive Neuroscience and serves as a core member and the Director of the Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience (CTN).1 This dual training as both a physician and a theoretical neuroscientist is not merely a biographical detail; it is the central organizing principle of his work. It creates a powerful intellectual bridge, allowing him to formulate research questions motivated by tangible neurological phenomena and address them with the formal rigor of computational modeling and advanced mathematics.

### **1.2 High-Level Summary of Scientific Contribution**

Dr. Anderson's overarching scientific contribution is the advancement of a research program dedicated to replacing vague, high-level psychological constructs with precise, mechanistic, and computationally explicit accounts of cognition. His stated approach emphasizes "mechanistically specific and computationally framed hypotheses combined with behavioural studies in normal subjects and people with focal brain injury".2

His work has progressed through a clear intellectual arc. It began with a systematic effort to demonstrate that many phenomena historically attributed to the concept of "attention" could be more parsimoniously and directly explained by the brain's capacity to learn and represent stimulus probabilities.1 This critical project led to a constructive one: investigating the mechanisms of statistical learning and representational updating. More recently, his focus has shifted to a more foundational level. As of 2021, he described himself as being "pre-occupied with how it is we represent uncertainty".1 This current phase of his research questions the adequacy of standard probability theory for modeling human belief, particularly in the context of unique, non-repeatable events, and seeks a more powerful formal language to describe these cognitive structures. This positions Dr. Anderson at the forefront of a movement aiming to enhance the theoretical precision and explanatory power of cognitive science.

### **1.3 Implications for Experiment Design**

The fusion of clinical neurology and theoretical neuroscience in Dr. Anderson's background has direct and significant implications for the design of experiments intended to engage with his work. His theoretical claims are not developed in a vacuum; they are consistently motivated by, and tested against, the realities of neurological dysfunction. His extensive work with patients suffering from focal brain injury, particularly right-hemisphere damage, serves as a critical constraint on his models of cognition.2 A computational model, in his view, achieves mechanistic validity not only by fitting data from healthy participants but also by being able to reproduce the specific patterns of deficit observed in patient populations when a relevant parameter is "lesioned."

This integrated approach suggests that the most compelling experimental designs to test or extend his theories would adopt a similar multi-pronged strategy. An ideal study would not rely on a single methodology but would instead incorporate what might be termed a "three-legged stool" approach:

1. **A Behavioral Paradigm:** A carefully designed task administered to a healthy adult population to measure a specific cognitive process (e.g., belief updating, perceptual estimation).  
2. **A Computational Model:** A formal, often simple, model that makes specific, quantitative predictions about performance in the behavioral task.  
3. **A Neuropsychological Component:** The administration of the same (or a simplified) behavioral paradigm to a relevant patient population (e.g., stroke survivors with right-hemisphere damage) to test the model's predictions about how the mechanism fails when its neural substrate is compromised.

By mirroring this structure, a researcher can design experiments that speak directly to the core principles of his research program, generating evidence that is robust, mechanistically informative, and clinically relevant.

## **Section II: The Theoretical Framework: From the Demise of "Attention" to the Formal Representation of Uncertainty**

Dr. Anderson's theoretical contributions are characterized by a coherent, multi-decade progression from a specific critique of an established psychological concept to a foundational re-evaluation of the tools used to model the mind. This trajectory can be understood as a continuous search for greater mechanistic specificity and formal rigor.

### **2.1 Deconstructing "Attention": A Call for Mechanistic Specificity**

A central and long-standing theme in Dr. Anderson's work is a profound skepticism toward the scientific utility of the term "attention." This critique is most explicitly articulated in his papers "There is no such thing as attention" (2011) and the more recent "Stop paying attention to "attention"" (2023).12 He argues that "attention" suffers from conceptual fragmentation, a state where a single term is used to refer to many different underlying processes, leading to confusion, ambiguity, and wasted research effort.14

His argument is not merely a preference for different terminology but a deep-seated conviction about scientific practice. The vagueness of a term like "attention" hinders theoretical progress because it allows researchers to label a phenomenon without explaining its underlying mechanism. In a 2021 interview, he suggested that it would be better to use newer, more tightly linked terminology to describe cognitive processes, rather than relying on the older, ambiguous concept of attention.8 He proposes a simple, if radical, solution: "Stop using the original term".14 To counter the argument that the concept is indispensable, he points out that "attention" is a relatively modern term whose original meaning is unrelated to current intuitions and that psychology made significant progress, even in cognitive domains, during the behaviorist era when its use was largely banished.14 The root cause of this problem, in his view, is a "dearth of theory driving cognitive experimentation".14 By compelling researchers to specify the actual mechanism at play—be it "statistical learning," "representational updating," or "perceptual precision modulation"—the field can move toward generating more precise, testable, and ultimately falsifiable hypotheses.

### **2.2 Probability as the Explanatory Engine**

Dr. Anderson's critique of "attention" is coupled with a constructive proposal: many of the behavioral and perceptual effects attributed to attention can be more directly and formally accounted for by the brain's ability to learn and exploit statistical regularities in the environment.1 This shift replaces a vague label with the mathematically tractable and powerful framework of probability theory.

His lab has produced a significant body of work operationalizing this idea. A common approach involves computer-based experiments where participants view sequences of stimuli with built-in probabilistic biases, and the lab assesses how people learn and are influenced by these patterns.8 This research has demonstrated that probability manipulations have profound effects on perception and action. For instance, stimuli with a high probability of occurrence are detected more quickly and accurately.15 More subtly, learning the probability of a specific feature, such as the orientation of a grating, can increase the

*precision* of its perceptual representation.9 This latter finding is particularly crucial, as it suggests that statistical learning penetrates early stages of perceptual processing, altering the quality of the percept itself, not just later decision-making or response stages. Further work has carefully dissociated the effects of different types of probability, showing, for example, that spatial probability and feature probability improve performance through different and independent mechanisms.9

### **2.3 The Current Frontier: The Nature of Uncertainty**

Having successfully used probability as an explanatory tool, Dr. Anderson's research has evolved to question the nature of the tool itself. His current work investigates the fundamental question of how the human mind represents uncertainty.1 He challenges the straightforward assumption, common in many Bayesian models of cognition, that subjective "degrees of belief" are equivalent to formal probabilities. This equivalence, he argues, may be inadequate for many real-world situations.

He points to two challenging cases: counter-factuals (e.g., arguing about alternate histories) and non-repeatable, single-shot decisions.1 The decision to go on a first date with someone, for example, is not something that can be modeled based on frequencies, yet we have stronger or weaker feelings about whether it is a good idea.1 While Bayesian accounts of such decisions embed probability distributions, Dr. Anderson raises critical questions about their nature: Are these mental distributions generic, or are they specific to the modality (e.g., visual, auditory) and the situation? How does the mind compare the similarity and difference between distributions to decide if the world has changed?.1 This line of inquiry marks a significant shift from using probability as a given to treating the representation of probability and uncertainty as the primary object of investigation.

### **2.4 The Search for a Formal Language: The Turn to Category Theory**

This deep questioning of existing formalisms has led Dr. Anderson to actively seek a new, more powerful mathematical language for cognitive science. He has become a "new enthusiast" of applied category theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with abstract structures and the relationships (or mappings) between them.1 His interest is motivated by a key problem in computational modeling: the potential misalignment between the natural language used to describe a theory, the mathematics that formally underlies it, and the computer code written to simulate it.1

He posits that category theory could serve as a "lingua franca" for cross-domain discussions and as a precise mathematical tool for analyzing the consequences of a model's abstract structure.19 To promote this vision, he chaired a workshop titled "Category Theory for Cognitive Science" at the 2022 meeting of the Cognitive Science Society, aimed at introducing researchers to its terminology and potential applications.19 He is particularly hopeful that this framework can "braid these two strings together"—that is, to formally connect the representation of uncertainty with probability theory, which can itself be developed from a category-theoretic perspective.1 His recent work reflects this growing interest; a 2025 preprint co-authored with Jeff Orchard aims to use category theory to develop a formal foundation for Vector Symbolic Architectures, a type of neural-symbolic model.22 This pursuit places him at the cutting edge of theoretical innovation in the field.

### **2.5 Implications for Experiment Design**

The coherent intellectual trajectory of Dr. Anderson's work—from critiquing "attention" to championing probability, to questioning probability's foundations, to seeking a new formalism in category theory—offers clear avenues for experimental engagement. Researchers can design studies that interact with this program at different stages.

One approach is to engage with his past and present work. This could involve designing an experiment that directly pits a probabilistic learning explanation against a classic attentional explanation for a given cognitive phenomenon. For instance, a researcher could create a cuing paradigm where the validity of a spatial "attentional" cue is systematically confounded with the underlying statistical probability of the target's location. By using fine-grained behavioral measures that Dr. Anderson favors, such as analyzing the full distribution of response errors rather than just the mean, one could determine which framework better accounts for the data.

A second, more forward-looking approach is to engage with the future direction of his research by tackling the problem of uncertainty head-on. This would involve designing novel paradigms to probe the nature of belief in the kinds of single-shot, non-frequentist scenarios he has highlighted. For example, an experiment could be developed around a complex, one-time decision (e.g., a strategic investment in a fictional scenario) that requires participants to integrate multiple, qualitatively different sources of uncertain information. The challenge would be to develop methods to elicit and measure their "degrees of belief" in a way that goes beyond asking for a simple probability rating, perhaps using a combination of confidence ratings, betting behaviors, and qualitative justifications. Such a project, aimed at providing empirical data for his new theoretical questions, would be high-risk but also high-reward, and a proposal for collaboration on such a topic would likely be received with great interest.

## **Section III: The Anderson Lab Toolkit: A Methodological and Computational Arsenal**

Dr. Anderson's lab employs a diverse and integrated methodological toolkit to address its theoretical questions. The strength of the research program lies not in any single method but in the convergence of evidence drawn from behavioral, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and computational investigations.

### **3.1 Behavioral Paradigms: Eliciting and Measuring Beliefs**

The behavioral paradigms used in the Anderson lab are designed to be sensitive to the nuances of statistical learning and belief formation. A common strategy involves computer-based tasks where participants are exposed to sequences of visual stimuli that contain embedded probabilistic regularities, and their ability to learn these biases is assessed through performance measures.8 The specific tasks are varied and tailored to the question at hand.

Early work often used perceptual estimation tasks, such as asking participants to report the precise orientation of a Gabor patch.9 This type of task is more informative than simple detection (i.e., "was the target present?") because it allows for the measurement of perceptual

*precision*—the variability of judgments around the true value. Analyzing the full distribution of errors provides a much richer dataset for testing computational models than simple accuracy or reaction time.9 Other paradigms include visual search tasks, where target properties are conditionally probable 25, and sequential decision-making games like a computerized version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, which are used to study strategy updating.9

A key methodological innovation from the lab is the "Plinko" paradigm.22 In this task, participants explicitly report their prior beliefs about a probability distribution before observing any data, typically by allocating a set of tokens into bins. This provides a "theory-free behavioral measure" of subjective priors, addressing a major limitation of many Bayesian models that must assume, rather than measure, these priors. More recently, the lab has moved toward more complex, ecologically-inspired tasks, such as using virtual maze navigation to investigate how people learn and integrate local and global probabilities in a dynamic environment.12

### **3.2 Neuropsychological Investigations: The Brain-Injury-as-Lens Approach**

A cornerstone of Dr. Anderson's research is the study of individuals with focal brain injury, which serves as a powerful tool for making causal inferences about brain function.2 This work, conducted in large part through a long-standing collaboration with Dr. James Danckert, primarily focuses on patients who have sustained right brain damage (RBD) following a stroke. This patient group provides a unique "natural experiment" to test theories of belief updating and representation.

The Anderson-Danckert research program has established that RBD is associated with a specific cluster of deficits. These patients show impairments in updating their mental models in response to new evidence 9, a failure to spontaneously explore new hypotheses when their current one is no longer effective 9, and deficits in statistical learning itself.9 This approach is also applied to understanding clinical syndromes like spatial neglect, which Dr. Anderson has reframed as a disorder of representing prior probabilities.10 The neuropsychological work is not an independent stream of research but is deeply integrated with the lab's theoretical and computational efforts. A valid computational model of, for instance, belief updating should not only fit the behavior of healthy individuals but should also be able to simulate the specific deficits of RBD patients when a component of the model is "lesioned" or its parameters are altered, as demonstrated with the RELPH model.11

### **3.3 Neuroimaging and Physiological Measurement: Finding the Neural Substrates**

To complement behavioral and neuropsychological data, the Anderson lab utilizes a range of neuroimaging and physiological techniques to identify the neural and bodily correlates of the computational processes under investigation. These methods provide converging evidence and help constrain the biological plausibility of the proposed mechanisms.

Eye-tracking is frequently used to gain a continuous, online measure of participants' expectations and biases. By monitoring where individuals look in anticipation of a stimulus, the lab can infer their learned model of the task's statistical structure.8 Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to achieve high-temporal-resolution insights into how probability affects neural processing. In a key study, the lab found that while low-probability "oddball" stimuli evoked a larger late P300 component (often associated with surprise or context updating), high-probability stimuli were associated with a

*dampened* C1 component.15 The C1 is the earliest visual evoked potential, thought to reflect initial processing in the primary visual cortex (V1). This finding provides strong evidence that statistical learning influences perception at its very earliest cortical stages, rather than being a purely post-perceptual or decision-level effect. The lab has also employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the larger-scale brain networks involved in these processes.8 Finally, pupillometry (measuring pupil diameter) has been used as an indirect proxy for the activity of ascending neuromodulatory systems (like the noradrenergic system), which are hypothesized to play a key role in mediating abrupt changes in perception and belief, or "network resets".29

### **3.4 Computational Modeling: Formalizing Hypotheses**

Computational modeling is the ultimate expression of a mechanistic hypothesis in Dr. Anderson's research program. The stated goal is often to "tie it all back together by developing a simple mathematical model" whose output can be directly compared to human behavioral output.8 For Dr. Anderson, a model is not merely an exercise in data fitting; it is a formal test of mechanistic understanding. The models are often kept intentionally simple to isolate and rigorously test a specific theoretical principle.

A prime example is the RELPH (Reinforcement and Entropy Learned Pruned Hypothesis space) model, which was developed to account for sequential decision-making behavior.11 The model was able to qualitatively and quantitatively reproduce the distinct behavioral patterns of healthy controls, left brain damaged patients, and right brain damaged patients in a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Crucially, the model suggested that the differences between groups could be explained by different policies for exploration, rather than a fundamental deficit in learning ability, providing a specific, testable mechanistic hypothesis. Dr. Anderson's commitment to computational methods is also evident in his open-source contributions on GitHub, which include educational code for implementing spiking neurons, various types of neural networks, and other computational tools in languages like JavaScript and Haskell.21

### **3.5 Implications for Experiment Design**

The methodological approach of the Anderson lab is best characterized as a search for "convergent evidence." A single theoretical question is typically interrogated from multiple angles, leveraging the strengths of behavioral, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and computational methods. The robustness of the lab's conclusions stems from the coherence of findings across these diverse lines of investigation. A theory about how probability learning modulates perception, for example, is supported by behavioral data showing improved precision in healthy participants 9, EEG data showing a modulation of the earliest visual ERP component 15, neuropsychological data showing that the ability is impaired after specific brain lesions 9, and a computational model that can simulate the learning process.8

For a researcher planning to design a study that engages with this work, this multi-modal philosophy is a key takeaway. While a purely behavioral study can certainly be valuable, its impact and relevance to the Anderson lab's program would be significantly enhanced by the inclusion of other components. A study that combines a behavioral paradigm with even a simple computational model that formalizes the hypothesis would be viewed as more rigorous. An experiment that also includes a neuroimaging (EEG/fMRI) or physiological (eye-tracking/pupillometry) component to test a specific neural prediction would be even more compelling. The ideal experiment, from this perspective, is one that generates a rich, multi-modal dataset that can be used to simultaneously test a behavioral prediction, identify its neural correlate, and constrain the parameters of a formal computational model.

## **Section IV: Analysis of Key Research Programs and Experimental Innovations**

Examining specific research programs in greater detail reveals how Dr. Anderson's theoretical motivations translate into concrete experimental and methodological innovations. These case studies highlight the interplay between theory, method, and collaboration that defines his work.

### **4.1 Case Study 1: The "Plinko" Paradigm \- A Methodological Innovation**

The development of the "Plinko" task is a direct methodological response to a theoretical problem Dr. Anderson identified in the cognitive modeling literature: the frequent use of untested assumptions about participants' prior beliefs.26 Bayesian models of cognition are defined by their use of priors, yet these are often inferred from behavior or simply assumed by the experimenter to be uniform or of a certain shape for all participants.

The Plinko paradigm was designed to be a "theory-free behavioral measure of priors for statistical learning and mental model updating".22 The task explicitly

*elicits* these priors by having participants distribute a set of tokens (e.g., 100 virtual chips) across a series of bins to represent their belief about how a set of items (e.g., balls dropped through a pegged pyramid) will be distributed. This is done *before* the participant observes any actual data from the distribution. This simple manipulation transforms the prior from an unobserved, assumed variable into a directly measured one.

Research using this paradigm has yielded important findings. First, it revealed that priors are not homogenous across individuals; instead, participants' initial beliefs tend to cluster around prototypical probability distributions, such as Gaussian or bimodal shapes.26 Second, it showed that these pre-existing belief structures influence how effectively individuals learn from subsequent data. Third, the task is flexible enough to study belief updating by measuring how participants change their token allocations after observing data, including how they respond to unannounced changes in the underlying distribution.26

For the purposes of experiment design, the Plinko task is a powerful and ready-made tool. Researchers in any domain involving statistical learning can adopt or adapt this paradigm to measure individual differences in priors. For example, one could use a Plinko-like task to get a baseline measure of a participant's prior belief about a distribution. This measured prior could then be used as a covariate or grouping variable in a completely different perceptual or decision-making experiment that uses the same statistical structure. This would allow for a rigorous test of the domain-generality of statistical priors and how they influence a wide range of cognitive tasks.

### **4.2 Case Study 2: Updating and the Right Hemisphere \- The Anderson-Danckert Program**

The long-standing and highly productive collaboration between Dr. Anderson and Dr. James Danckert represents a model of how to integrate computational theory with clinical neuropsychology. This research program has systematically investigated the role of the right cerebral hemisphere in the critical cognitive function of belief updating.

Using their "brain-injury-as-lens" approach, they have demonstrated that patients with right brain damage (RBD) exhibit a consistent pattern of impairments related to adapting to a changing world. Their work has shown that RBD patients struggle to update their internal mental models when the statistics of their environment change.9 This is not simply a matter of slow learning; these patients also show a "failure to explore new hypotheses," sticking with a previously successful strategy long after it has ceased to be effective.9 This work has been complemented by neuroimaging studies in healthy individuals, which have helped identify a cortical network, with a key node in the right hemisphere, that appears to mark the precise moment when a conscious representation is updated.9

This research program provides some of the strongest evidence for the causal role of the right hemisphere in the kinds of probabilistic computations that are central to Dr. Anderson's theories. While fMRI can show which brain areas are correlated with a task, the lesion studies demonstrate that the right hemisphere is *necessary* for normal updating behavior. Any comprehensive theory of belief updating, therefore, must be able to account for this specific pattern of deficits. For an experimenter, this body of work provides a clear target. A novel experimental paradigm designed to probe a specific aspect of mental model updating could be made significantly more powerful if it is designed from the outset to be simple enough to be administered to both healthy controls and a stroke patient population, allowing for a direct test of the Anderson-Danckert model.

### **4.3 Case Study 3: Navigating Uncertainty \- The Current Research Frontier**

Dr. Anderson's most recent work, exemplified by the 2024 paper "Updating local and global probabilities during maze navigation" (co-authored with graduate student Sixuan Chen), showcases his current focus on the representation of uncertainty in more complex, dynamic environments.12 This research moves beyond simple stimulus probabilities to investigate how different types or scales of uncertainty are managed and integrated.

In the experiment, participants navigated a virtual maze where the walls were obscured. They had to rely on two sources of information to find their way: local cues (providing immediate, proximate information) and a global direction (providing distal, abstract information). The key manipulation was to separately vary the reliability (i.e., the probability of being correct) of the local and global cues. The results showed that while participants were able to use both sources of information effectively, they demonstrated a stronger reliance on the more immediate local cues and were more precise in their estimation of the reliability of those local cues.27

This study is significant because it directly operationalizes Dr. Anderson's theoretical questions about the nature of uncertainty representation. It successfully dissociates two distinct forms of probability—proximate/local versus distal/global—and examines the process of their integration in a decision-making task. This work opens up a new and fertile domain for future research. An experimenter could build on this paradigm in several ways:

* **Neuroimaging:** Use fMRI or EEG to search for distinct neural signatures associated with the tracking of local versus global probabilities.  
* **Neuropsychology:** Administer a similar task to patient populations with specific lesions (e.g., to the hippocampus for spatial mapping, or the prefrontal cortex for goal maintenance) to see if the two systems can be doubly dissociated.  
* **Computational Modeling:** Develop a computational model, perhaps using principles from reinforcement learning or Bayesian inference, that can reproduce the observed behavioral preference for local cues and make novel predictions about how this preference might change under different task demands.

## **Section V: The Collaborative Network and Intellectual Sphere**

Dr. Anderson's research is not conducted in isolation but is deeply embedded within a structured intellectual ecosystem. His collaborative network is a key asset, providing the diverse expertise required to pursue his multi-modal research agenda. Understanding this network is crucial for identifying opportunities for future engagement.

### **5.1 Key Collaborators and Research Foci**

Analysis of Dr. Anderson's publication record reveals a set of consistent and strategic partnerships, each contributing a specific component to the overall research program.

* **James Danckert (University of Waterloo):** Dr. Danckert is arguably Dr. Anderson's most significant and frequent collaborator. Their joint work forms the foundation of the lab's neuropsychological investigations. Together, they have co-authored numerous papers on mental model updating, the cognitive consequences of right hemisphere damage and stroke, statistical learning impairments in patients, and the nature of spatial neglect.9 This partnership appears highly symbiotic, with Dr. Danckert's expertise in clinical neuropsychology and access to patient populations providing the critical empirical data needed to test and constrain Dr. Anderson's theoretical and computational models.  
* **Former Students and Postdoctoral Fellows:** Dr. Anderson's mentorship has cultivated a generation of researchers who have made significant contributions.  
  * **Alex Filipowicz** (now at the University of Pennsylvania) is a co-author on key papers related to updating, the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, and the innovative Plinko paradigm.9  
  * **Syaheed B. Jabar** was the first author on foundational studies demonstrating how orientation and spatial probability modulate perception and response speed through distinct mechanisms.9  
  * **Elisabeth Stöttinger** collaborated on influential work on updating impairments, RBD, and decision-making strategies in competitive games.9  
  * More recent students like **Peter A. V. DiBerardino** (Plinko, probability antimatching) and **Sixuan Chen** (maze navigation) continue to push the lab's research into new methodological and theoretical territory.22  
* **The Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience (CTN):** As Director of the CTN, Dr. Anderson is situated within a world-class environment for computational and theoretical research.1 This context facilitates collaborations with experts like  
  **Jeff Orchard**, a specialist in machine learning and computational neuroscience. Their recent joint work on using Category Theory to formalize Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) is a clear product of this intellectually rich environment.22 The broader CTN, known for the development of the Nengo large-scale brain modeling framework (led by Chris Eliasmith), provides a backdrop of ambitious, neurally realistic computational modeling that informs the lab's work.

### **5.2 Implications for Experiment Design**

The structure of Dr. Anderson's collaborative network reveals a clear operational strategy: he serves as a theoretical and computational hub, connecting to various "spokes" that provide essential expertise and data. Dr. Danckert is the neuropsychology spoke, former students like Dr. Jabar provided the perceptual expertise spoke, and colleagues like Dr. Orchard provide the advanced computational and mathematical formalism spoke.

This structure offers a clear roadmap for potential collaborators. Rather than approaching Dr. Anderson with a vague expression of interest, a researcher can frame a proposal by identifying a gap in this ecosystem that their own expertise can fill. The most effective proposals will be those that offer to build a new, complementary spoke for the hub.

For example, a researcher could frame a proposal in one of the following ways:

* **A New Modality:** "My lab has extensive experience with auditory statistical learning. We propose a collaboration to test whether the mechanisms of belief updating you and Dr. Danckert have identified in the visual domain are modality-general, by adapting your paradigms for the auditory system."  
* **A Different Patient Population:** "Your work has powerfully demonstrated updating deficits in stroke patients. My research focuses on patients with Parkinson's disease, who have known deficits in probabilistic learning related to basal ganglia dysfunction. A joint project could investigate whether these deficits are better explained by your models of updating or by classic reinforcement learning accounts."  
* **A Novel Analytical Technique:** "We have developed a new method for analyzing EEG data that allows for the decoding of subjective uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis. We believe applying this technique to data from your perceptual estimation paradigms could provide a more direct neural measure of the belief distributions your models predict."

By demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of his existing collaborative structure and clearly articulating how their unique contribution can extend his research program in a new direction, potential collaborators can significantly increase the likelihood of a successful engagement.

## **Section VI: Pedagogical Footprint and Open-Source Contributions**

Dr. Anderson's approach to teaching and his open-science practices provide a valuable window into his core intellectual philosophy. These resources not only disseminate knowledge but also serve as a practical guide to the concepts and tools he considers essential, effectively acting as a "user manual" for his research program.

### **6.1 Teaching as a Window into Core Philosophy: PSYCH 420**

Dr. Anderson's teaching portfolio includes PSYCH 306 (Perception) and, most notably, PSYCH 420 (An Introduction to Computational Neuroscience Methods).32 The design and goals of PSYCH 420 are particularly revealing. The course is explicitly intended for psychology students who may have little to no prior background in advanced mathematics or programming.34 This framing reflects a core philosophy of demystification and empowerment: he aims to break down barriers and equip psychologists with the fundamental tools of computational science.

The course objectives, detailed in publicly available syllabi, outline what he considers to be the essential building blocks of the field.35 The curriculum progresses logically from the mathematics of single neurons (requiring an understanding of differential equations) to the mathematics of neural networks (requiring an understanding of linear algebra). It even includes explorations of more abstract computational concepts, such as programming a simple Turing machine to interrogate the very meaning of "computation" in the context of the mind.37 He uses his own textbook,

*Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Modelling*, and a dedicated GitHub repository to support the course, ensuring students have access to all necessary materials.21 Student feedback is consistently positive, with reviewers describing him as an articulate, engaging, and clear instructor who is "old school in the best of ways".32

### **6.2 Open Science in Practice: The GitHub Repositories**

Dr. Anderson's commitment to education and open science extends beyond the classroom through his public GitHub profile (brittAnderson).21 This profile serves as a repository of practical tools and educational materials that are freely available to the wider research community.

The repositories include:

* **Course Materials:** Intro2Computing4Psychology and compNeuroIntro420 contain guided introductions, notes, and code for his courses, targeted at beginners.21  
* **Educational Resources:** histPsychol is an online textbook for the history of psychology.21  
* **Practical Tools:** parseEdf contains Haskell scripts for parsing data files generated by EyeLink eye-trackers, a direct, practical contribution to researchers using that common piece of equipment.21  
* **Workshop Materials:** cogSci2022-Category-Theory-Workshop houses the notes and materials from the influential workshop he chaired at the Cognitive Science Society meeting.21

This open-source activity is a tangible manifestation of his call for greater clarity and rigor in the field. By sharing his code and teaching materials, he lowers the barrier to entry for students and researchers wishing to adopt computational methods, fostering a more computationally literate and technically skilled community.

### **6.3 Implications for Experiment Design**

For a researcher planning an experiment, Dr. Anderson's pedagogical and open-source materials are an invaluable resource. They provide a "user manual" for his intellectual framework, revealing how he deconstructs complex topics, which mathematical and computational concepts he views as foundational, and the specific software tools he employs.

By studying the PSYCH 420 syllabus, one can trace his preferred pedagogical path from differential equations to linear algebra to logic, gaining an understanding of how he builds a computational worldview from the ground up.35 By examining the code in his GitHub repositories, one can see the specific programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Haskell, Racket) and level of abstraction he favors.21

This has direct, actionable implications. Before proposing a collaboration or submitting a grant that involves a computational model, a researcher would be well-advised to consult these resources. Framing a new model in terms of the concepts he teaches (e.g., explicitly discussing the linear algebra underlying a network model) or building a simulation using the tools he provides would demonstrate a deep and serious engagement with his work. This signals a shared conceptual language and a common understanding of what constitutes a rigorous computational approach, making any proposal far more likely to be well-received. Furthermore, practical resources like the parseEdf repository represent a direct gift to the community, offering a ready-made solution for a common data processing challenge in experimental psychology.

## **Section VII: Synthesis and Directives for Experimental Design**

### **7.1 Culminating Synthesis: The Anderson Research Program**

The research program of Dr. Britt Anderson is a sustained and disciplined effort to increase the mechanistic clarity and formal rigor of cognitive neuroscience. His work is propelled by a fundamental dissatisfaction with vague, high-level psychological constructs like "attention." In response, he has systematically built an alternative framework grounded in the mathematics of probability and the mechanisms of statistical learning. This framework is not developed in isolation; it is constantly shaped and validated by insights from his original training as a clinical neurologist. He wields a powerful, multi-modal toolkit—combining behavioral paradigms, neuropsychological studies with brain-injured patients, neurophysiological measurement, and computational modeling—to build a web of convergent evidence around his theories. His intellectual journey has now led him to the frontiers of the field, where he questions the very foundations of how probability is used to model belief and champions the adoption of more powerful formalisms like category theory to build the next generation of cognitive theories. In essence, Dr. Anderson's project is to replace black-box labels with transparent, testable, and computationally explicit models of how the brain navigates an uncertain world.

### **7.2 Identifying Open Questions and Future Directions**

The analysis of Dr. Anderson's work reveals several key tensions and open questions that represent the "bleeding edge" of his research and fertile ground for future investigation.

* **The Nature of Belief:** A central tension exists between his critique of standard probability for modeling belief in unique events (the "first date" problem, which feels rich and continuous) and his turn toward the highly abstract, discrete, and symbolic structures of Category Theory. How can these two be reconciled? What does a category-theoretic model of a subjective, non-frequentist "degree of belief" actually look like, and what novel predictions would it make?  
* **Open Question 1 (Local vs. Global Updating):** The recent maze navigation study dissociated the use of local and global probabilities.27 A major open question is whether the underlying neural mechanisms are also dissociable. Does the right hemisphere's well-established role in "updating" apply equally to both rapid, local updates and slower, global model revisions, or are there distinct neural systems for each?  
* **Open Question 2 (The Origin of Priors):** The Plinko paradigm has successfully shown that individuals have idiosyncratic prior beliefs that influence learning.26 However, the origin of these priors remains unknown. Are they stable, trait-like features of an individual's cognitive architecture, or are they flexibly shaped by long-term experience? Can they be altered through training?  
* **Future Direction (Applied Category Theory):** The most significant future direction for his work is the transition from *advocating* for Category Theory as a useful language to actually *using* it to build a novel, predictive, and empirically testable cognitive model. The 2025 preprint with Jeff Orchard is a first step 22, but the challenge of creating a full-fledged categorical model of a psychological phenomenon (e.g., belief updating) remains.

### **7.3 Actionable Recommendations for Experimental Design**

For a researcher seeking to design experiments that are relevant, impactful, and positioned to engage with Dr. Anderson's research program, the following actionable recommendations are derived from the preceding analysis:

* **Recommendation 1: Adopt the "Three-Legged Stool" Approach.** The most robust and compelling studies in this domain integrate multiple methodologies. For maximum impact, design experiments that combine a behavioral component, a formal computational model, and a neural or neuropsychological component to test the model's biological plausibility.  
* **Recommendation 2: Measure, Don't Assume, Priors.** If an experiment involves any form of statistical learning, avoid assuming uniform priors across participants. Incorporate a "Plinko-like" pre-task to directly measure each individual's subjective prior beliefs. Use these measured priors as covariates or grouping variables in the primary analysis to increase statistical power and theoretical precision.  
* **Recommendation 3: Target the "Updating" Mechanism.** Design paradigms that specifically manipulate the need to update a mental model versus simply applying a stable one. This is a core theme of his work. Using tasks with non-stationary statistics, where the underlying probabilities change without warning, is a proven way to probe this mechanism.38  
* **Recommendation 4: Frame Hypotheses Mechanistically.** Scrupulously avoid the language of "attention" in proposals and manuscripts. Instead, frame all hypotheses in the specific, mechanistic language that Dr. Anderson champions. For example, instead of "attentional capture by the cue," use "faster response initiation times driven by learned spatial probabilities." This demonstrates an understanding of his core theoretical commitments.  
* **Recommendation 5: Engage with the Formalism.** When proposing or developing a computational model, pay explicit attention to its formal structure. Even if not using advanced mathematics like Category Theory, clearly discussing the model's underlying principles (e.g., "our model is a linear transformation on the input vector," or "the learning rule is a variant of a delta-rule") will align with his deep emphasis on formal rigor and clarity. Consulting his open-source course materials is an excellent way to learn the preferred "style" of modeling.  
* **Recommendation 6: Identify a Gap in the Collaborative Ecosystem.** The most strategic approach to collaboration is to propose a project that provides a missing piece to his existing research program. Frame the proposal around a new modality (e.g., audition, haptics), a different patient population that can test a key theoretical distinction, or a novel analytical technique that can be applied to his central research questions. This demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of his work and offers clear, complementary value.

## Analysis Summary

### Dr. Anderson in a Nutshell
* Champions replacing vague constructs (e.g., "attention") with **formal, mechanistic models** of cognition.
* Uses **probability learning & belief updating** as core explanatory engines, now questioning how uncertainty itself is represented.
* Prefers **multi-modal evidence**: behavioural tasks, computational models, neuropsychology (RBD patients), and physiological measures.
* Pedagogical mission: **demystify computational methods** for psychology students (see PSYCH 420).

### Code-Ready Experiment Ideas for Students
*Below you'll find five experiment concepts written in plain language. Each one is paired with a suggested folder name (so you can reference it with @ in chats) and a short description of how it works and why Dr. Anderson would find it compelling.*

#### 1. exp_orientation_probability – Seeing What You Expect
Imagine a simple game where the screen flashes angled lines ("Gabors"). Some angles appear far more often than others. Over time, people get **sharper** at judging those frequent angles—they literally "see" them more precisely. A PsychoPy script can randomise the angles, bias the probabilities, and record the tiny errors in participants' angle estimates. Plotting those errors shows how mere exposure to probability changes perception—exactly what Dr. Anderson demonstrated in his 2014 work, but now in code students can read and tweak.

#### 2. exp_plinko_priors – What Do You Believe Before You Begin?
Before running any task, ask participants to drop 100 virtual chips into a "Plinko" histogram to show what outcomes they *expect* to see. That simple drag-and-drop interface (easy to build in PsychoPy.js + plain JavaScript) captures a person's **prior beliefs**—no guessing by the experimenter required. Afterwards the script runs a quick visual estimation task and shows how those priors shape subsequent learning. This hands-on demo mirrors Dr. Anderson's "theory-free" measurement of priors.

#### 3. exp_rps_updating – Outsmarting Rock-Paper-Scissors
Everyone knows Rock-Paper-Scissors, but few stick to perfect randomness. This experiment pits a human against an adaptive opponent. Behind the scenes, a few reinforcement-learning (RL) models compete to predict the human's next move. Students can watch live graphs of prediction accuracy and see how quickly (or slowly) people **update** their strategy—paralleling the RELPH model that Dr. Anderson used to tease apart learning vs. exploration in sequential decisions.

#### 4. exp_maze_uncertainty – Lost in a Probabilistic Maze
Participants steer a dot through a foggy maze. Local signs give immediate hints ("turn left!") while a distant compass offers a fuzzier global direction. By silently varying how reliable each hint is, the task reveals whether people trust **local** or **global** information when the two conflict. A lightweight Three.js or Unity WebGL scene collects path data and confidence ratings. The setup brings Dr. Anderson's 2024 maze-navigation study to life in an interactive, visual format.

#### 5. exp_category_vectors – Playing with Symbolic Vectors
How can symbols and neurons mix? Using the `nengo` Python library, students build a tiny **Vector Symbolic Architecture** that binds two concepts (e.g., COLOUR *red*, SHAPE *square*) into a single high-dimensional vector. A few lines of code then show how to unbind and retrieve the original concepts. This toy example demystifies the category-theory-inspired formalism Dr. Anderson is now exploring and gives psychology students a first taste of neural-symbolic computation.

### In-Depth: exp_rps_updating
At its heart, this study asks: *How quickly do people adapt their strategy when facing an opponent that is learning about them?*

1. **Task Flow**
   - Participants play ~150 rounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors against an on-screen opponent.
   - The opponent starts random but gradually shifts to exploit any biases in the participant's choices (implemented with a simple reinforcement-learning algorithm).
   - After every 10 rounds the screen shows a running score and a confidence slider asking, "How predictable do you think you are right now?"

2. **Key Manipulations**
   - **Opponent Adaptation Rate:** Slow vs. fast learning opponents to see if humans notice and adapt.
   - **Feedback Granularity:** Immediate win/loss feedback versus block feedback to test the role of explicit error signals in updating.
   - **Surprise Trials:** Occasional forced-choice trials (e.g., "must play Rock") to measure exploration tendencies.

3. **Data Collected**
   - Choice sequence (R/P/S per trial)
   - Reaction times
   - Self-reported predictability/confidence
   - Opponent's model estimates of participant bias

4. **Analysis Ideas**
   - **Entropy of Choice Distribution:** Lower entropy ⇒ stronger bias; plot over time to visualise adaptation.
   - **Shift Lag:** Trials needed for participant strategy to change after opponent exploitation becomes obvious.
   - **Model Comparison:** Fit simple RL models (e.g., win-stay-lose-shift vs. Q-learning) to participant behaviour and compare AIC/BIC.
   - **Exploration Index:** Frequency of surprising moves after a streak of losses.

5. **Why It Speaks to Anderson's Interests**
   - Directly targets the *updating mechanism*—does the participant recognise a changing environment and revise behaviour?
   - Generates rich behavioural data plus a computational model, satisfying the three-legged stool (behaviour + model; neural component could be added later).
   - Simple enough to run in a web browser, aligning with his pedagogical aim of accessible computational demonstrations for psychology students.

##### RL Algorithm Variants to Toggle
For extra depth—and to let students explore how *algorithmic assumptions change behaviour*—code the opponent as a pluggable module with three switchable strategies:

1. **Win-Stay-Lose-Shift (WSLS)** – A simple heuristic: repeat a winning move, switch after a loss. Good baseline that captures some human tendencies.
2. **Q-Learning with Softmax Exploration** – Classic model-free RL. Updates action values after each round and selects moves via a temperature-controlled softmax. Adjustable learning rate (α) and exploration (τ).
3. **Bayesian Opponent Model** – Maintains a Dirichlet posterior over the human's choice distribution and picks the action with highest expected win probability. Updates analytically, no step size.
